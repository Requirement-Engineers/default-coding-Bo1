# Intention and Implementation

Let's say our intention is to count
the number of customers coming into a store.

A possible piece of python code would be:

    COUPLE = 2
    customers += COUPLE

Is this correct and complete?

It depends on several factors.
Let's start with these:
How long does it need to run? When should it restart the count?
While these questions feel trivial,
it's surprising how frequently they are missed.
