## Default habits for Faster Quality

This site advocates 'defaults' - the styles you use, unless there's a strong reason not to. These styles are developed by habit and they are designed to give faster quality.

### Refactor with stateless functions
An application would have many processing-points: Parts that transform an input to an output. Here's an example
{% gist 638a7be3a5c71937f194532de90a1e2d %}

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sudeeprp/default-coding/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
