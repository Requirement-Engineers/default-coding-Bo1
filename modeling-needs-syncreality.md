# Reality Check

## Tracking and Tracing Requirements

<<Regulatory, Support

Common fields to describe a requirement:

- ID, date, version, status, priority, risk, stakeholders

## Typical Requirement Workflow

<<Proto to production to end-of-life

## Requirements traceability needs

<<Verification, design

## Failures in Tracking and Tracing

### Implementation overtakes requirements

Requirements are hard to change

<<impact analysis: Change in 3rd party dependency, user-convenience (login from alistair)

### Legacy shackles are unknown

<<successful product, unclear what users like

## Strategies for Success

- [Hierarchy with bidirectional tracing](modeling-needs-hierarchy.md)
- [Tracking tools with approval-workflow](modeling-needs-hierarchy.md)
- [Requirements = Tests](modeling-needs-as-tests.md)
