# Neutral Metrics

Neutral metrics are those that don't require human judgement
to interpret.

Examples:

* A gate of zero compiler warnings is neutral;
reviewing warnings to check if they are acceptable is not
* Maximum cyclometric complexity is neutral;
an opnionated 'maintenance indicator' % given by a tool is not -
though reported by a tool, the opinions are human :)

Gating on neutral metrics gives the team a direction with
specific targets.
Non-neutral metrics are good as overall motivators / as benchmarks.
